# Run Papa Rara Run

https://nathanlong.itch.io/run-papa-rara-run

This is a silly little game that I made with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) as a learning exercise.

I modified the core of the game off of Phaser's 'Phaser By Example' guide, and then proceeded to gut it, convert it to Typescript and load it with new custom assets.
